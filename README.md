# Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

Step 1: Prepare Your Model Files
Before starting, make sure you have your trained model and label encoders. You need to:

Export your trained model as encryption_model.pkl
Export your label encoders as label_encoders.pkl
Create a directory named model and place both files inside it

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
bash# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn joblib gunicorn
Step 3: Start the Flask Server
Run the Flask application:
bashpython app.py
The server will start on port 5000 by default. You can verify it's running by accessing:

http://localhost:5000/health

Step 4: Test with the Sample Client
Run the sample client to test the API:
bashpython client.py
You can choose to run a simulation with multiple virtual sensors or send specific requests.
Docker Deployment (Optional)
If you prefer to use Docker:
bash# Build the Docker image
docker build -t encryption-recommender .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/model:/app/model encryption-recommender
Or using Docker Compose:
bash# Uncomment the Docker Compose section in the Dockerfile
docker-compose up
API Usage
Predict Endpoint
Send POST requests to /predict with the following JSON structure:
json{
  "file_size": "Small",
  "data_type": "Text",
  "required_speed": "Low",
  "security_level": "Medium",
  "real_time": "No",
  "connectivity": "WiFi",
  "cost_sensitivity": "High"
}
Response Format
Successful responses will have this structure:
json{
  "predicted_algorithm": "AES-256",
  "input_parameters": {
    "file_size": "Small",
    "data_type": "Text",
    "required_speed": "Low",
    "security_level": "Medium",
    "real_time": "No",
    "connectivity": "WiFi",
    "cost_sensitivity": "High"
  }
}
Integrating with Sensors
To integrate real sensors with this system:

Have your sensors make HTTP POST requests to the /predict endpoint
Include all required parameters in the request body
Parse the response to get the recommended encryption algorithm
Implement the recommended algorithm in your sensor's encryption module
